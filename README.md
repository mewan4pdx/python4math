# python4math

The scripts in this repo will help create a Python 3.10 virtual environ,
that will contain specific packages for math notebooks.

Running the virtual environment requires a working Python, in this example
it is Python/gcc/3.10.10/gcc-12.1.0 prebuilt module.  If you do not have
modules, then a vanila Python 3.10 install will also work.
